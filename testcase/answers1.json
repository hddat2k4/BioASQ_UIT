Besides that, we also find the highly unchanged genes are enriched in some other pathways, such as the nutrient-sensitive signaling pathway. To facilitate the investigation of unique UCSs, the UCSC Genome Browser was utilized to visualize the chromosomal position and related annotations of UCSs in S.cerevisiae genome.",

Despite being emblematic of the New Guinea fauna, no previous phylogenetic studies have been conducted on the Eupholini. In addition to a comprehensive collection of fresh specimens, we supplement our taxon sampling with museum specimens, and this study is the first target enrichment phylogenomic dataset incorporating beetle specimens from museum collections. We use both concatenated and species tree analyses to examine the relationships and taxonomy of this group. For species tree analyses we present a novel partitioning strategy to better model the molecular evolutionary process in UCEs. We found that the current taxonomy is problematic, largely grouping species on the basis of similar color patterns. Finally, our results show that most loci required multiple partitions for nucleotide rate substitution, suggesting that single partitions may not be the optimal partitioning strategy to accommodate rate heterogeneity for UCE loci.",

Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the >80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-κB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results identify three novel genes in SLE susceptibility and support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation.",

Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing-from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq clustering are not well developed. Available methods often yield a high frequency of under-clustering artifacts that result in spurious barcodes, or over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender, an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data.Results: In contrast with existing methods that cluster based on sequence similarity alone, Bartender uses a modified two-sample proportion test that also considers cluster size. This modification results in higher accuracy and lower rates of under- and over-clustering artifacts. Additionally, Bartender includes unique molecular identifier handling and a 'multiple time point' mode that matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods.Availability and implementation: Bartender is available at no charge for non-commercial use at https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1.",

Depletion of Hotair and SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

To understand the genetic basis of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) susceptibility, a complex and highly prevalent congenital malformation, we searched for genetic variants with a regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle [OOM]), of affected individuals. From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells. Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i.e., DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample. MRPL53 (2p13.1) encodes a 39S protein subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes and interacts with MYC, a transcription factor required for normal facial morphogenesis. ",

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020).

However, Deep Learning has not yet been applied to drug synergy prediction, which is the approach we present here, termed DeepSynergy. DeepSynergy uses chemical and genomic information as input information, a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity, and conical layers to model drug synergies.Results: DeepSynergy was compared to other machine learning methods such as Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Elastic Nets on the largest publicly available synergy dataset with respect to mean squared error. DeepSynergy significantly outperformed the other methods with an improvement of 7.2% over the second best method at the prediction of novel drug combinations within the space of explored drugs and cell lines. At this task, the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the measured and the predicted values of DeepSynergy was 0.73. Applying DeepSynergy for classification of these novel drug combinations resulted in a high predictive performance of an AUC of 0.90. Furthermore, we found that all compared methods exhibit low predictive performance when extrapolating to unexplored drugs or cell lines, which we suggest is due to limitations in the size and diversity of the dataset. We envision that DeepSynergy could be a valuable tool for selecting novel synergistic drug combinations",

We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements.

Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. ChromoTrace is a computational methodology to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. ChromoTrace uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. The algorithm can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences.",

        "text": "The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve genome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path based on super-resolution microscopy images.",
